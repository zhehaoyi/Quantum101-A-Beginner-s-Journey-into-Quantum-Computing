# ðŸ“˜ Quantum Computing Intro Guide

This repository contains a simple **introductory guidebook on quantum computing**.  
The goal is to explain key ideas of **classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and computing** in a clear and engaging way, using analogies, diagrams, and a few Python examples.  

You donâ€™t need a strong background â€” just curiosity. Topics include:
- Newtonâ€™s laws and classical mechanics  
- Core ideas of quantum mechanics (superposition, entanglement, measurement)  
- From bits to qubits  
- Basic quantum circuits and algorithms  
- A small hands-on quantum computing project with Python (NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, TensorCircuit)
